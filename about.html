        <p class="tob">the only bot you'll ever need.</p>
        <p class="desc" >What first began as a simplistic python bot used for slack.com has qucikly grown into one of the most revolutionary bots on Discord today. Ubi, built with you in mind, was designed in a fashion that ensures a high quality experience with the bot installed. Since ubi uses installable modules to run (rather than a huge file), anyone can submit contributions to Ubi in the form of python source files. This allows you to customize your server the way you've always dreamed of, with both your, and other people's modules.

            Simply put, ubi is the bot built by you, the people <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i></p>
        
<p class="scrdesc">Although, you don't need fancy extra modules to get started with Ubi. Ubi comes jam-packed with oodles of goodies like a basic Music plugin, Calculator, Dictionary, and even Scrabble! These modules were designed to be both standalone andx` interact with other crowd-sourced modules.</p>
